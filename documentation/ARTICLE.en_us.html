    Menbere is an Ethiopic font with a Latin matched to it. Aleme Tadesse designed Menbere with assistance from Eben
    Sorkin for the Latin. It is published by Sorkin Type Co. While contemporary in feeling, Menbere avoids being
    influenced by the Latin script. In the design of Menbere, Aleme judiciously modernized traditional Ethiopic using
    low-contrast strokes that retain traditional gestures. Due to its multiple weights, and formal style, Menbere is an
    excellent choice for use in corporate design, both in print and on screen as well as UI and wayfinding. Menbere is
    also well suited to mixed script typesetting.

    Menbere is named after Aleme’s mother. “Menbere” means “seat of
    honor”. Menbere uses different word spaces for texts set in Ge’ez derived languages vs those in Latin for additional
    ease in reading with the Ethiopic script benefiting from a more expansive word space. All Ge’ez script derived
    languages are covered including Amharic, Tigrinya, Tigre, Bilen, and Harari.
